# VBA-challenge

# For this Module, I collaborated with Charlotte, Mike, and Adam in breaking down the different steps of the code to gain a better understanding of it. Otherwise, the only code that was taken from an external source was for the formatting of the numbers to show as percentages and AutoFit.

# EDIT: My code had to run twice to get everything properly formatted but I thought it was my computer being slow so I had kept it as is. With the help of Mike, we updated the script so that everything should just run once!
